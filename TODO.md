* Debug flag to print JSON contents and other info
* ***Robust error handling***
* Per-session cache of already requested directories to reduce traffic and improve response time

* Look into websocket interface?
* Switch to lua-cjson 2.1.0 in place of dkjson (exact same syntax and semantics but an order of magnitude faster)
* Support transcoding (o mama!)

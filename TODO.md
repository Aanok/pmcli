* Debug flag to print JSON contents and other info
* ***Robust error handling***
* Per-session cache of already requested directories to reduce traffic and improve response time
* Global search (will require command syntax amendment; might require item tag refactoring)
* Make mpv work on playlists of adjacent items instead of launching and closing one process each time (has to be 
for audio only because it is incompatible with specifying subtitles :( )
* Look into websocket interface?
* Support transcoding (o mama!)
